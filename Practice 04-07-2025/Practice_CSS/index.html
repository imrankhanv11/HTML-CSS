        <p>The max-height property defines the maximum height of an element.

            If the content is larger than the maximum height, it will overflow. How the container will handle the
            overflowing content is defined by the overflow property.

            If the content is smaller than the maximum height, the max-height property has no effect.

            Note: This prevents the value of the height property from becoming larger than max-height. The value of the
            max-height property overrides the height property.

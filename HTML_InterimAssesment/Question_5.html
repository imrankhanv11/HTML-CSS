		<h3>Politics :</h3>
		<p>BJP leader and former Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said Gandhi's claim of spreading the message of love amid alleged hatred 
		is merely an excuse for him as his priority is to spread hate against India's development under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership.
		Addressing a joint media conference with Nitish and Tejashwi, Soren said that during the discussion a course of action was planned on the role 
		of the Opposition. “We discussed how, as opposition leaders, we can bring about equality of thoughts within the Opposition (camp),” the JMM leader said.
